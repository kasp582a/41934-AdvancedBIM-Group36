# 41934 - Advanced BIM - Group 36

## Introduction
The goal is to support the user in optimizing the building and reduce the use of material through FEM analysis. In this assigment there has been made a phyton script that make a new propertySet and inserting properties in a IFC file such as the moment of inertia and Young's modulus of elasticity. These new properties are ofc not enough we also need Support and actuel calculation, this will be futher be descibed in the report.

# 3D: Value What is the potential improvement offered by this tool? 

## Cost Reduction

The tool is projected to significantly reduce material costs, offering a direct financial benefit. By refining material requirements, the tool also potentially lowers secondary expenses related to logistics and handling.

## Efficiency and Productivity

Automating the FEM analysis and integrating it with BIM workflows through IFC compatibility is expected to accelerate the design process. This increment in productivity could enhance employee job satisfaction and allow businesses to reallocate resources to innovation-driven tasks.

## Competitive Edge

The capacity to deliver optimized structural designs may provide a significant competitive advantage in the market, promoting the business as a pioneer in smart construction methods.

## Risk Management

The advanced analysis capabilities of the tool will likely facilitate early detection of structural design issues, mitigating risks associated with construction errors and subsequent liability.

## Environmental Management

Material optimization directly contributes to environmental conservation by decreasing the demand for raw materials, thereby reducing the environmental footprint of construction projects.

# IFC models

The model used and the modified model are uploaded on learn due to them beeing a skylab model.

# Phyton script 
The Python script created for this assignment is designed to enhance an IFC file by inserting structural parameters such as the moment of inertia and Young's modulus of elasticity. This is achieved by creating a new PropertySet and inserting properties. For this task, a new PropertySet has been associated with a specific beam element named "Rectangular and Square Hollow Sections:SB10:2518553," bearing the global ID: 0PBox$QKjEKQwoUJvZkwUp.
