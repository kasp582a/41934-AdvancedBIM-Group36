# 41934 - Advanced BIM - Group 36

# Assignment A3 OpenBIM ReModel
## Introduction
The goal is to assist the user in optimizing the building and reducing material usage through FEM analysis. In this assignment, a Python script has been created to make a new property set and insert properties into an IFC file, such as the moment of inertia and Young's modulus of elasticity. These new properties are, of course, not sufficient, we also need support and actual calculations, which will be further described in the report

# 3D: Value What is the potential improvement offered by this tool? 

## Cost Reduction

The tool is projected to significantly reduce material costs, offering a direct financial benefit. By refining material requirements, the tool also potentially lowers secondary expenses related to logistics and handling.

## Efficiency and Productivity

Automating the FEM analysis and integrating it with BIM workflows through IFC compatibility is expected to accelerate the design process. This increment in productivity could enhance employee job satisfaction and allow businesses to reallocate resources to innovation-driven tasks.

## Competitive Edge

The capacity to deliver optimized structural designs may provide a significant competitive advantage in the market, promoting the business as a pioneer in smart construction methods.

## Risk Management

The advanced analysis capabilities of the tool will likely facilitate early detection of structural design issues, mitigating risks associated with construction errors and subsequent liability.

## Environmental Management

Material optimization directly contributes to environmental conservation by decreasing the demand for raw materials, thereby reducing the environmental footprint of construction projects.

# IFC models

The model used and the modified model are uploaded on learn due to them beeing a skylab model.

# Phyton script 
The Python script created for this assignment is designed to enhance an IFC file by inserting structural parameters such as the moment of inertia and Young's modulus of elasticity. This is achieved by creating a new PropertySet and inserting properties. For this task, a new PropertySet has been associated with a specific beam element named "Rectangular and Square Hollow Sections:SB10:2518553," bearing the global ID: 0PBox$QKjEKQwoUJvZkwUp.

### description of the code
As descibed in the assingment A3, the code is designed to enhance an IFC file by inserting structural parameters such as the moment of inertia and Young's modulus of elasticity. This is achieved by eather creating a new PropertySet and inserting properties or editing an exiting PropertySet. The scipt use a "try" block to make error handling efficient which was very usefull when writting the code. The code are using a library called 'ifcopenshell' which are indispensable when handling ifc files, therefore the used functions and attributes from 'ifcopenshell' are descibed below.

#### Used functions in the library 'ifcopenshell'

* ifcopenshell.open(path)
  Open an ifc file from a path
* ifc_file.by_guid(guid)
  Used to get an element by is guid (Global ID)
* ifcopenshell.is_a(obj, type)
  Can check if an object is a spesefic type, used to check if a object is a property set
* ifcopenshell.guid.new()
  Makes a new Global ID
* ifc_file.by_type(type_name)
  Get a list of all entities of a specific type, used to set OwnerHistory,
  Which is a required parameters when making a new Propertyset.
* ifc_file.createIfcPropertySet(arguments)
  Can create a new poperty set
* ifc_file.createIfcRelDefinesByProperties(arguments)
  Can create relationship between elements and property sets
* ifc_file.createIfcReal(value)
  Create a number in IFC format
* ifc_file.createIfcPropertySingleValue(name, value)
  Can create single-value property by name and value 
* ifc_file.write(path)
  Can save the new modefied model in a path

* Name
  
* HasProperties
  
* NominalValue
  
* wrappedValue
